    # We try to mimic the behaviour of google calendar emails:
    #
    # 1. We add the icalendar twice to the email:
    #    * once as a `text/calendar` part (with a `method=` in the content type),
    #    * once as an `application/ics` attached .ics file.
    #
    # 2. The method is PUBLISH or CANCEL, not REQUEST: we don’t want replies.
    #
    # 3. the `application/ics` attachment is base64-encoded
    #
    # 4. the `text/calendar` part is base64-encoded, too.
    # This is different from Google: quoted-printable, in ActiveMailer, encodes line breaks as =0D\n,
    # and this seems to break the Outlook automatic integration. #1354

    # The final email parts look like this:
    # - multipart/mixed
    #   - multipart/alternative
    #     - text/plain
    #     - text/html
    #   - text/calendar
    #   - application/ics
    # Google calendar puts the text/calendar inside the multipart/alternative part.
    # We might want to try that too.
