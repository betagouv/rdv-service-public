module TextSearch
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  # Full Text Search support, using pg_search.
  #
  # Models including this concern need to have:
  # * a :search_terms text attribute in database
  # * a :search_keys class method returning the names of the attributes to use for searching.
  # Additionally, :search_terms, and :email if used, should be indexed in the database.
  # The search_terms index looks like this:
  #   add_index :user, to_tsvector('simple'::regconfig, COALESCE(user.search_terms, ''::text)), using: :gin
  #
  # This module has three roles:
  # 1. Make sure the search terms are up-to-date when the model is saved
  # 2. Special case email search by using the :email column
  #   This is needed to search for partial emails,
  #   e.g. when searching "john.doe@example" should return the row containing "john.doe@example.com".
  #   That wouldn't work with PG text search because PG actually parses the text token, and a valid email is
  #   saved as one token ("john.doe@example.com‚Äù") while an invalid email is several tokens ("john.doe", "@", "example")
  #   See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-parsers.html
  #   If the search term looks like an email, we search on email only.
  #   We can't combine the query with search_on_search_terms as it would lose the text ranking.
  # 3. Special case phone number search by normalizing the phone number
  #   We store phone numbers in e164 form.
  #   When searching "01 23 45 67", we want to return the row containing "+33123456789".
