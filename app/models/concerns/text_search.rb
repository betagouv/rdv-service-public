module TextSearch
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  # Full Text Search support, using pg_search (https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search).
  # See https://github.com/betagouv/rdv-solidarites.fr/pull/2791.
  #
  # Models including this concern need to have a :search_against class method returning
  # a configuration that will be used for the "against:" parameter of pg_search.
  #
  # This module has three roles:
  # 1. Declaring the base configuration for pg_search
  # 2. Special case email search by using the :email column
  #   This is needed to search for partial emails,
  #   e.g. when searching "john.doe@example" should return the row containing "john.doe@example.com".
  #   That wouldn't work with PG text search because PG actually parses the text token, and a valid email is
  #   saved as one token ("john.doe@example.com‚Äù") while an invalid email is several tokens ("john.doe", "@", "example")
  #   See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-parsers.html
  #   If the search term looks like an email, we search on email only.
  #   We can't combine the query with full_text_search as it would lose the text ranking.
  # 3. Special case phone number search by normalizing the phone number
  #   We store phone numbers in e164 form.
  #   When searching "01 23 45 67", we want to return the row containing "+33123456789".
